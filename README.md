# Angle Protocol

This repo contains the Core Smart Contracts of the Angle Protocol. It is these contracts that are going to be deployed on mainnet and that have been audited by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime.

## Documentation

Angle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. For more information about the protocol, you can refer to [Angle Official Documentation](https://docs.angle.money).

If you would like to know how the protocol works under the hood and how these smart contracts work together, you can also check [Angle Developers Doc](https://developers.angle.money).

The smart contracts of the protocol are structured as follows:

For a broader overview of the protocol, you can also check the [Angle Interfaces Repo](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/angle-interfaces).

## Audits

Angle smart contracts have been audited by Sigma Prime and [Chainsecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/angle-protocol/). The audit reports can be found in the `audits/` folder of this repo. Every contract of the protocol has been audited at least by one of the two auditors. 

The `main` branch of this repo contains the code of the contracts that have been deployed. The other branches are the audited branches.

## Usage

Note that this repo is not the repo on which the Angle Core Team develops. This one, containing all the tests around this code, will be shared after the official launch of the protocol. We still feel that it is important for everyone to be able to evaluate the content of the smart contracts of the protocol before interacting with it on mainnet.

## Responsible Disclosure

At Angle, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But even putting top priority status and maximum effort, there is still possibility that vulnerabilities can exist.

In case you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it immediately so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible.

If you discover a vulnerability, please do the following:

    E-mail your findings toâ€¯contact@angle.money;

    Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered;

    Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved;

    Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam or applications of third parties; and

    Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation so we might ask you for additional information.

We will promise the following:

    We will respond to your report within 3 business days with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date;

    If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you in regard to the report;

    We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission;

    If you so wish we will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem;

    In the public information concerning the problem reported, we will give your name as the discoverer of the problem (unless you desire otherwise); and

    As a token of our gratitude for your assistance, we offer a reward for every report of a security problem that was not yet known to us. The amount of the reward will be determined based on the severity of the leak, the quality of the report and any additional assistance you provide.
